# welcome to data science at GA!

## anaconda installation 
- click here for installer (python3.4): http://continuum.io/downloads#py34 
- download installer, double-click .pkg file
- follow installation wizard

note that this installation edits your system search path (!) 
- `which python`
- look at your `~/.profile` file

if you don't like this, you can revert the change & create a separate shortcut
to anaconda 
- edit `~/.profile` 
- create a symbolic link with `ln` (`man ln` for help)
