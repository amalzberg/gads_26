# welcome to data science at GA!

You're seeing this file here because it's the README for the base directory of
this
[repo](http://readwrite.com/2013/09/30/understanding-github-a-journey-for-beginners-part-1).
We'll use it to keep track of useful links and information.

**NOTE** keep an eye out for new material about data exploration at the command
line...coming in the next day or two
