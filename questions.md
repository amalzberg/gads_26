## small-group questions
don't look these up yet...just talk to your neighbor/s to come up with some answers

*1) define these statistical terms*  
distribution, mean, median, mode, standard deviation, variance, skew, fat
tails, quartile, scatterplot, outlier 

*2) describe these distributions using 1 word each*   
normal distribution, exponential distribution, uniform distribution 

*3) take a look at one of the datasets in this repo. what does it describe? what are some ways you could summarize this data?* 

*4) what's the difference between an array and an associative array? how are
these implemented in python? what are some other fundamental python data 
structures?*

*5) define these python terms*  
iterable, immutable, context manager, lambda, package, namespace, lazy evaluation 

*6) take a look at dartboards.png. how would you characterize the accuracy for
each target?*

*7) discuss a cool data visualization you've seen with your neighbor*
